# Machine learning projects
##### This repository will contain projects of all sizes with the goal of improving my understand of Data Science and Machine Learning. All projects will be contained in this repository and seperated into their own appropriate folders within the repository. When appropriate, Jupyter Notebook will be used to assist in visualization.

## Hand-written number identifier
This project is a work in progress. This will use the mnist dataset to create a program that can identify hand-written numbers.
